This guide is ***ONLY*** meant to be followed if the [3DS Hacks Guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide) methods do not work! If you are looking to hack your 3DS please follow [3DS Hacks Guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide) instead!

## What is this page for?

This page is a collection of all old methods that can be used if for whatever reason the main guide is unusable. You will most likely be redirected here. If you were not redirected here by the main guide, please follow [3DS Hacks Guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide) instead.

## What does this guide install?

This guide will install **boot9strap + Luma3DS custom firmware** on **unmodified/stock** 3DS/2DS devices. If you have installed custom firmware in the past, you should follow [these instructions](checking-for-cfw) to find the correct upgrade path for your console. A modern, boot9strap/Luma3DS-based setup is preferred over older setups (arm9loaderhax, menuhax) because it is more stable for modern homebrew and continues to be supported by the community.

## What do I need to know before starting?

* While the risks of bricking have been minimized over the years, **we are not responsible for anything that goes wrong with your device**. Incorrect file placement will not brick your device, but reckless behavior might.
* This guide will work on every retail device in the Nintendo 3DS family of consoles (including the New 3DS series and the 2DS), regardless of region or firmware.
* Following this guide alone should not result in data loss, but SD card corruption is always a possibility. You should make a backup of your SD card contents if you have important data.
* You will need a working SD card in your 3DS, as well as the ability to write files to the SD card. The 3DS can read SD cards formatted as MBR/FAT32.
