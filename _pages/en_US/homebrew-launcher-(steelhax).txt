### Required Reading

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to gain access to the Homebrew Launcher using the Steelhax exploit for the purposes of injecting an exploitable DSiWare title into the DS Download Play application. This method requires you to already own (or download) the free "Steel Diver: Sub Wars" game from the eShop.

If your device already has access to the Homebrew Launcher (whether through Steelhax or another exploit), you can skip to [DSiWare Dumper](dsidumper)).

If you already have Steel Diver: Sub Wars, this process will overwrite your game's save file!
