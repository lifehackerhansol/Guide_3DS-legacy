#### Section IV - Installing boot9strap

1. Wait for all checks to complete
1. When prompted, input the key combo given on the top screen to install boot9strap
1. Once it has completed, press (A) to reboot your device

#### Section V - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Your device should have rebooted into the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#black-screen-on-sysnand-boot-after-installing-boot9strap)
1. Use the (A) button and the D-Pad to turn on the following:
  + **"Show NAND or user string in System Settings"**
1. Press (Start) to save and reboot
  + If you get an error, just continue the next page

At this point, your console will boot to Luma3DS by default as long as the SD card is inserted.
  + Luma3DS does not look any different from the normal HOME menu. If your console has booted into the HOME menu, it is running custom firmware.
  + On the next page, you will copy Luma3DS to internal memory so that you can boot without an SD card.
