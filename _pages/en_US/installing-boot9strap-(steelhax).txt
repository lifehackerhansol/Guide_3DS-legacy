### Required Reading

Steelhax is a savegame exploit for Steel Diver: Sub Wars. It is compatible with versions 1.0.0 through 11.15.0 on EUR, USA, or JPN region devices.

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to write a custom save file for Steel Diver: Sub Wars, which can then be used with universal-otherapp to run SafeB9SInstaller.

If you already have Steel Diver: Sub Wars, this process will overwrite your game's save file!
